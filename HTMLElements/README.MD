# HTMLElements - SEO Checklist

Tags are small snippets of HTML coding that tell engines how to properly “read” your content. In fact, you can vastly improve search engine visibility by adding SEO tags in HTML.

When a search engine’s crawler comes across your content, it takes a look at the HTML tags of the site. This information helps engines like Google determine what your content is about and how to categorize the material.

Some of them also improve how visitors view your content in those search engines. And this is in addition to how social media uses content tags to show your articles.

In the end, it’s HTML tags for SEO that will affect how your website performs on the Internet. Without these tags, you’re far less likely to really connect with an audience.

## Use Title Tags

Perhaps one of the most important HTML tags for SEO is that of the title. This is the label of your content and how searches see your page in Google and Bing. Every result you see in a search engine is derived from the title tag.

```
<title>About | Fossbarrow</title>
<title>Home | Fossbarrow</title>
```

## Use Meta Tags

HTML uses `<meta>` tags to define metadata about a HTML document. These tags are placed inside the `<head></head>`section. Metadata is the information about your website. Metadata is not displayed on the webpage but it is parsed by web crawlers and search engines.

It has a few Attributes:

| Attribute  | Description                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| name       | Describes the name for the metadata                    |
| content    | Describes the value of the metadata                    |
| charset    | Describes the character encoding for the HTML document |
| http-equip | Provides the HTTP header for information               |

### Description

Defines the description about the website. The description should be up to 160 characters.

`<meta name="description" content="This is a short description about your site." >`

## Use OpenGraph Meta Tags

Open Graph meta tags are snippets of code that control how URLs are displayed when shared on social media.

These are the most basic meta tags that you should use for all content types:

| Tag            | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| og:image       | The URL of the image that appears when someone shares the content to Social media                                                                  |
| og:type        | Describes The type of media of your content.                                                                                                       |
| og:locale      | Describes The The locale of the resource.                                                                                                          |

Twitter has its own `<meta>` tags that are similar to the Open Graph protocol, but uses the “twitter” prefix instead of “og”. As with Facebook, only a few are required. The type of display format we’re requesting from Twitter is also specified:

| Tag                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Use Body Tags

The <body> tag defines the document's body.
The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

## Use Semantic Tags

Semantics in HTML means "role" or "purpose". When we use `<div></div>` tags they hold no meaning which is saying they are generic tags. They can hold any content inside of them but it does not provide us enough information.

Semantic Tags clearly describe the meaning of the content they contain to everyone and make it easier for search engines and web crawlers to search for information effectively.

Here are some common Semantic Tags :

| Attribute                   | Description                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<article></article>`       | describes independent, self-contained content               |
| `<aside></aside>`           | describes indirectly related content like sidebars          |
| `<code></code>`             | describes code snippets contained in web documents          |
| `<figcaption></figcaption>` | describes the content of the parent `<figure>` element      |
| `<figure></figure>`         | describes content like illustrations and diagrams           |
| `<footer></footer>`         | represents a footer for the parent element                  |
| `<header></header>`         | contains introductory content like images or heading        |
| `<main></main>`             | represents most of the content in the `body` section        |
| `<nav></nav>`               | contains navigation links to the same or any other document |
| `<section></section>`       | describes a section in a document for a particular topic    |
| `<table></table>`           | describes a table containing various types of data          |
| `<time></time>`             | represents a specific period in time                        |

## The href Attribute

The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to: <a href= www.Google.com>Google</a>

## The src Attribute

The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed: <img src="Github_Logo.jpg">

## Use Alt tags in Images

Search engines cannot determine what images are trying to convey. That’s when the ALT tag comes into play. The ALT represents what the image is : <img src="Github_Logo.jpg" alt="Github Logo">

## Use Header Tags

Header tags are often used to break up the content to make it easier to read. In reality, about 55% of visitors will only spend [15 seconds at most skimming your content.](https://buffer.com/resources/55-visitors-read-articles-15-seconds-less-focus-attention-not-clicks/)

Headers make it easier for these people to find what they’re looking for quickly.

Here’s an example; what if I have a reader on this blog who is merely interested in Open Graph tags? He or she can then scroll down to find the header for it and get the information.

Otherwise, the reader can simply leave the page without engaging the content at all.

In terms of SEO, header tags are also what search engines use to help determine segments of content and create [featured rich snippets](https://www.greengeeks.com/blog/why-should-you-want-your-site-to-be-in-the-google-featured-snippet/).

Here is the hierarchy of header tags:

- `<h1></h1>` – usually reserved for webpage titles.
- `<h2></h2>` – highlights the topic of the title.
- `<h3></h3>` – reflects points in regards to the topic.
- `<h4></h4>` – supports points from `<h3>`.
- `<h5></h5>` – not often used, but great for supporting points of `<h4>`.
## The Meta tag 
In terms of SEO ,<meta> tag is the most important tag which engines us to detect what kind a content your site is actually offering . <Meta> tag defines metadata about your html documents.
If my webpage contains the data about languages likeg html, css and javascript and i want to provide this information to my search engine then 
Here is the syntax :-
<meta name="keywords" content= "HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT">
If i want to describe the viewport for my website (how my website will appear). Then i'll use the following syntax in my head tag:-
<head>
<meta name="viewport" content ="width=device=width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
<head>

## Use Alt tag/attribute
<alt> tag is an alternative tag also known as "alt attribute" which is applied in the image tags to provide the text alternative for search engines And today tagging images and video is essential to having your page rank.These titles essentially tell the search engines what content is actually your site offering .For example if you're having chocolate image in your site then you can use alt tag as <img alt="chocolate"> .If your site will not load then "chocolate" will display as an alternative.
